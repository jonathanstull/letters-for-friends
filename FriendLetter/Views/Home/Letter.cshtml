    <h1>HELLO FROM AFAR</h1>
    <p>Dear friend,</p>
    <p> How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in Iceland while I learn programming!</p>
    <p>Friend, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
    <p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you some black sand.</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Jonathan</p>
